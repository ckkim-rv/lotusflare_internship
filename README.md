# lotusflare_internship
Projects I worked on at LotusFlare. Certain parts of the code have been redacted for company privacy.
- After analyzing LotusFlare's Jira data, I worked on this python script that sends emails to engineers and product managers once their jira ticket is due in 7 days, due in a day, and every day once the ticket becomes overdue.
- The emails are only sent to the creator and assignee of tickets.
